# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple Bash script to calculate **Simple Interest** based on the user-provided values of principal amount, rate of interest, and time (in years).  
This project is created as part of a migration from SVN to Git to promote open-source collaboration in our micro-finance startup.

## ðŸ“œ Formula

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- **P** is the Principal amount
- **R** is the Rate of interest
- **T** is the Time in years

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have a Bash environment (Linux/macOS or WSL/Git Bash on Windows):

```bash
chmod +x simple-interest.sh
./simple-interest.sh
